"""Unit test for the ``require`` narrowing helper.

``require`` is the shared primitive behind the Optional-narrowing guards in the
publisher/consumer loops (queue, client, pool, producer). It stands in for
``assert x is not None`` but raises unconditionally, so it survives ``python
-O`` where ``assert`` would be stripped -- turning a stray ``None`` into a clear
``RuntimeError`` instead of an opaque ``AttributeError`` inside a detached task.
